<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>
    In addition to the studies presented in the paper we also investigated the applicability of, <b>Transfer Learning</b>, a model trained for one dataset used to infer predictions for another dataset.
    In specific, we trained Random Forest models on one of our datasets, and evaluated its performance when applied to predict faults in either one of the three datasets.
    The models were optimized and trained using a gridsearch approach.
    No crossvalidation was necessary, as, in general, separate datasets were used for training and testing purposes.
    A noteworthy exception are the three evaluations of the three classifiers trained and tested on the same dataset (e.g. EN - EN).
  </p>
<h1>Plot Type</h1>
  <p>
    To compare model prediction performances, we employ a custom plot type, the <b>Precision / Recall / F1 plot</b>, that combines precision, recall, and f1-performance for a specific evaluated model.
    The evaluation result of each trained model is illustrated by a symbol in the plot area.
    For any given symbol in the plot, its horizontal position corresponds to the precision score of the evaluated model.
    Likewise, its vertical precision corresponds to the Recall score of the evaluated model.
    Lastly, the symbol's position in relation to radial lines indicate the model's achieved F1 measure.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use abbreviations of the datasets in the legend (EN = Enron Errors, IN = Info1, EU = Euses).
    The first term in each legend entry signifies the dataset that was used to train a model.
    The second term signifies the dataset that the resulting classifier was evaluated on.
    E.g., the red triangle symbolizes the result of a Random Forest model that was trained on then Enron Errors dataset, and evaluated on the Euses dataset.
