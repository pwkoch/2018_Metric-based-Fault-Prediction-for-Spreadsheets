title: Mutation Operators
description: Evaluation of Mutation Operators

<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>
    The EUSES dataset, used in our evaluations, comprises of real-world spreadsheets that contain artificially induced faults.
    The faults were created by applying previously tested mutation operators on randomly chosen cells.
    It stands to argue whether the spreadsheets can be considered as representative of realistic error cases.
    To answer this question, we conducted a comparison of the EUSES dataset with the known, genuine faults contained in the Enron Errors dataset.

  <p>
    In detail, we manually inspected each sheet of the Enron Errors dataset, and checked how many of the real-world faults in each sheet can also be introduced by (repeated) application of the mutations that were used to create the EUSES dataset.
    According to this analysis, 20 of the 31 different fault types in sheets of the Enron Errors corpus can be recreated using mutations.
    We regard this result as indicative, that even artificially created sheets can provide meaningful examples of real world faults that occur due to, e.g. typos.
    We used the <a title="overview of Enron Errors dataset" href="http://ls13-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/homepage/spreadsheets/enron-errors.htm">spreadsheet containing an overview of the Enron Errors dataset</a> to document this analysis, and extended it with respective information regarding the reproducibility of the different fault types using mutation operators.
    The resulting sheet is available <a title=".xlsx file for mutation analysis" href="appendix/data/mutationAnalysis/EnronErrors_mutationComparison.xlsx">here</a>.
